\begin{abstract}
    Traditionally, the document search system in Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT)  relies on keyword-based search. The problem of this method is that it limits the search accuracy and user experience due to their inability to understand context or semantics. This study explores the integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), vector-based similarity search, and Large Language Model (LLM)-powered conversational interfaces to optimize document retrieval systems. OCR enables the extraction of text from scanned or image-based documents, ensuring inclusivity of diverse file formats. Vector embeddings facilitate semantic understanding, enabling more accurate retrieval by identifying contextual similarities rather than exact keyword matches. Meanwhile, the conversational interface powered by LLMs enhances user interaction by allowing intuitive, natural language queries and follow-up clarifications. This approach is evaluated against traditional methods in terms of search accuracy, user experience, and retrieval efficiency. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed system significantly outperforms traditional approaches, offering a more accessible, intelligent, and efficient solution for managing and retrieving diverse document types.\\ \\
